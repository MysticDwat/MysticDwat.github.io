            <h1 class="center">Pedestrian Simulation</h1>

            <p>
                The pedestrian simulation is a Python project done with the VPython library that simulates the movement
                of pedestrians in an environment with obstacles. Pedestrians move using a gradient descent cost function
                that use a series of cost functions from various sources.

                    <p>
                        As a box cannot not be covered accurately by a radius without unwanted
                        behaviour, my solution was to place the origin for the cost function at the point nearest to the
                        pedestrian on the box. The point is found by getting the angle between the axis vector of the box and
                        the distance vector between the pedestrian and the box. Using the angle, we get the x or y displacement
                        from the center and get the other displacement as half of the width or length based on the box quadrant
                        the point falls in. Once we get the local coordinates of the point we apply a transformation that
                        rotates and translates the point to global coordinates, which we use as the origin of the cost function.

                        An obstacle can be either a cylinder, a box, or another pedestrian. The cost generated by an obstacle is
                        centered on a point and uses the function ln(R/d) when d < R where R is a given radius from the center
                        and d is the distance from the pedestrian and the obstacle. Cylinders and pedestrians use their own
                        center position as the origin for the cost function, however boxes use a different method of finding the
                        origin for the cost function.

                I ran the simulation with two environments, the first being a doorway with an obstacle in front and the
                second being a T-intersection (see GIFs above). If you want to see more about the project, please visit

            <h1>Movie Website</h1>

            <p>
                The Movie Website is a website where a user can view movies and favorite them with a card presentation
                similar to Netflix. The homepage presents the top ten movies of each genre along with the user's
                favorited movies. A user can also view more info about a movie via a button on the card.
            </p>

            <p>
                All data for movies and users are in a MongoDB database stored on the backend. Users have their
                passwords stored as a hash in the database to protect their passwords from anyone viewing the database.
                Users must also confirm their email address by clicking on a confirmation link sent by email using
                Nodemailer.

                        Crazy Dates is an app where couples can explore their area by going on dates. Each date gives the user
                        an event and food type, with all matching locations displayed in a Google Maps widget. While only
                        currently a website prototype, there are plans to eventually move the app to mobile with more features
                        and settings.

                        The app mainly uses the Google Maps and Places API in React, through the @react-google-maps/api package
                        and the Places JS Library. Each option for events and food have set queries that are sent to Text Search,
                        which returns the results as markers on the Google Map.
