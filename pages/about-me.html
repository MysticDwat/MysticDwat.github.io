            <p>
                Hello, I am William Hottenstein, a current computer science senior at Florida Institute of Technology.
                I am experienced in Python and C, having worked on a variety of small scale projects over my time as a
                programmer. My personal drive in computer science is to push myself with new and interesting problems
                that challenge both my logic and creativity. I always look forward to learning about a new tool or
                concept in computer science, no matter the field.
            </p>

            <p>
                For any project, I love to dive in and give it my all till completion. I have worked in both individual
                and team settings, bringing my own approaches to problems. I am currently looking for work, either full-time, part-time, or freelance, that has flexible hours and
                an interesting challenge. If you are interested, please contact me by email at
                whottenstein2019@my.fit.edu or through my <a href="contact-me.html">Contact Me</a> page.
            </p>
